# CPP Module 09 - Working with Containers and Ford-Johnson algorithm

## Overview
This module introduces working with **containers** in C++ and the implementation of the **Ford-Johnson algorithm**.

## Key Topics
- **STL Containers**: Working with standard containers like `std::vector`, `std::stack`,  `std::deque`, and `std::map`.
- **Ford-Johnson algorithm**: Implementing a specific algorithm (minimum number of comparisons) for a computational problem.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Ensuring that the algorithm runs efficiently on large datasets.

## Notes
- I got used to gdb debugging while trying to fix ex02.
